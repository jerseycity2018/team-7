## Purpose
Rare is an NGO focused on addressing human behavior as the both the cause and solution of conservation and development challenges. This project aims to combine both behavioral insights and technology to create a product that encourages people to conciously act in ways that better serve the environment. A central component is the interactive map, where users can see the individual conservation efforts made by people both in their community and even abroad (and add their own!). This encourages participation by leveraging social incentives and emotional appeals. Users who participate might even find themselves featured on the leaderboard.
